            The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the six original Japanese breeds, and is agile and well suited to mountainous terrain. The Shiba Inu were originally developed as a breed for hunting. It is similar in appearance to the Akita dog, but is smaller in size. And it is one of the few ancient dog breeds that survive to this day.
